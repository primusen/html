            Hello, my name is Eskil and I am 16 years old. I go to senior high school at Amerikanska Gymnasiet 
            in Stockholm. I struggle a lot with motivation but I would like to overcome that eventually, 
            maybe this website could help. I started learning code when I was 12. I started with learning 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file" target="_blank">Batch</a>. Then I started learning C# to make
            games with Unity. I did make some games but they were very simplistic and I made them by following 
            tutorials.
